  intro: >-
      Communities are at the heart of many Web3 projects, but they also present significant security risks. 
      Attackers frequently target community managers, moderators, and users through phishing, impersonation, 
      and social engineering. A compromised account can quickly become an attack vector for broader scams. 
      This section provides best practices to secure community platforms such as Discord, Telegram, Twitter (X), and Google.

  checklist:
      # -------------------------------
      # General Security Practices
      # -------------------------------
      - point: Enforce Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Require 2FA for all administrators and moderators on community platforms. 
            Prefer authenticator apps or security keys over SMS-based methods to prevent SIM swapping attacks.

      - point: Use Unique, Strong Passwords
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            All community team members should use long, unique passwords stored in a reputable password manager. 
            Never reuse passwords across multiple platforms.

      - point: Educate Members on Phishing Attacks
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Clearly communicate that official team members will **never** send unsolicited direct messages (DMs). 
            Phishing attacks often impersonate admins, moderators, or support accounts.

      - point: Regularly Audit Permissions and Roles
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Frequently review and update permissions for all roles to enforce the principle of least privilege. 
            No one should have more access than necessary.

      - point: Use Cold Admin Accounts for High-Risk Actions
        priority: Advanced
        details: >-
            Designate a separate **"cold" admin account** with minimal exposure for performing critical actions 
            such as changing settings, revoking permissions, or handling security incidents.

      # -------------------------------
      # Platform-Specific Security
      # -------------------------------

      # Twitter (X)
      - point: Remove Phone Number from Twitter
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Attackers frequently use SIM swaps to bypass security. Go to [Phone Settings](https://x.com/settings/phone) 
            and remove your phone number.

      - point: Enable 2FA on Twitter
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Use [Security Keys](https://x.com/settings/security) or an authenticator app instead of SMS-based 2FA.

      - point: Revoke Access to Suspicious Third-Party Apps
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Regularly check [Connected Apps](https://x.com/settings/connected_apps) and revoke unnecessary access.

      # Discord
      - point: Require 2FA for Discord Moderation
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Enforce 2FA for all moderators in **Server Settings > Moderation** to prevent unauthorized account takeovers.

      - point: Limit Administrative Privileges in Discord
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Remove the **Administrator** permission from all non-essential roles. Set **role-based access** instead of granting blanket permissions.

      - point: Implement Anti-Impersonation and Anti-Raid Bots
        priority: Optional
        details: >-
            Use bots such as **Wick** or **Beemo** to prevent impersonation, raids, and automated scams.

      - point: Restrict DM Access for Discord Members
        priority: Optional
        details: >-
            Prevent mass phishing attacks by disabling direct messages from server members under 
            **User Settings > Privacy & Safety**.

      # Telegram
      - point: Hide Your Phone Number in Telegram
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Set your phone number to **Nobody** in **Settings > Privacy and Security > Phone Number** to prevent unwanted contact or social engineering.

      - point: Disable Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Calling
        priority: Optional
        details: >-
            Prevent IP leakage by disabling **P2P calling** under **Settings > Privacy and Security > Calls**.

      - point: Use Secret Chats for Sensitive Conversations
        priority: Optional
        details: >-
            Regular chats on Telegram are **not** end-to-end encrypted by default. Use **Secret Chats** for high-risk communication.

      - point: Train Members on "Man-in-the-Group" Attacks
        priority: Advanced
        details: >-
            Attackers can impersonate team members in Telegram by cloning groups and altering payment details. 
            Always verify group authenticity before making transactions.

      # Google
      - point: Enable Advanced Protection for Google Accounts
        priority: Advanced
        details: >-
            Enroll high-risk team members in [Googleâ€™s Advanced Protection Program](https://myaccount.google.com/advanced-protection/landing) 
            to prevent unauthorized access.

      - point: Remove Recovery Phone Number and Email
        priority: Essential
        details: >-
            Reduce attack surfaces by removing recovery phone numbers and emails. **Navigate to:**

            - [Recovery Email](https://myaccount.google.com/recovery/email)

      - point: Monitor Active Google Sessions
        priority: Optional
        details: >-

            and terminate unknown logins.
